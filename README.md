# SecureCommProtocol-SSL-TLS
This repository contains the implementation of a Secure Communication Protocol designed for robust client-server communications. It leverages SSL/TLS for handshake protocols, ensuring data security and integrity during transmission.

## Features
- Symmetric and Asymmetric SSL/TLS Communication
- Implementation using Python with detailed server and client code
- Utilizes AES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanisms
- Focus on data encryption and decryption for secure transmission

## Security Considerations
- Detailed documentation on potential security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
- Emphasis on key sizes, algorithm selection, and error handling for enhanced security

## Testing
Comprehensive test cases ensuring reliability and robustness of the implementation

## Usage
Follow the instructions in respective server and client Python scripts to set up and initiate secure communication.

## Contribution
Suggestions and contributions are welcome to enhance the protocol's security and efficiency.
